# Collection of Scribus icons

For the convenience of designer and testers, this repository contains all icons used by Scribus.

The idea is that anybody can fork this repository, modify all or part of the icons, do a pull request and everybody gets a set of files that can be used by everybody in their Scribus.

Since the Scribus license is not a standard GPL and the exceptions added by the Scribus team to the code are not needed for the icons, we had to strip all the existing content from the the icons in this repositories.  
The small advantage is that this repository now uses a CC-BY-SA license that is better suited for pictures.  
Please do not copy existing icons from the Scribus code in this repository! Our license is compatible with the Scribus one, but the Scribus one is not compatible with this' repositories license! (Yes, this is crazy, but that's life)

# Todo

- Find better names for most of the icons and create a patch that allows to use the icons in Scribus.
- Create a scripts that copies the icons that have been defined into the installed Scribus directory (or lets restore the original images).
