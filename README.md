# Collection of Scribus icons

For the convenience of designer and testers, this repository contains all icons used by Scribus.

The idea is that anybody can fork this repository, modify all or part of the icons, do a pull request and everybody gets a set of files that can be used by everybody in their Scribus.

One thing that is probably needed, is to improve and make consistent the icon names.
